                <h4>Unsupervised Substructure Discovery in Metabolomics</h4>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolomics">Metabolomics</a> is the large-scale, untargeted
                    studies of the small molecules involved in essential life-sustaining chemical processes
                    (metabolites).
                    Untargeted metabolomics has provided insights into a wide array of fields, such as medical
                    diagnostics,
                    drug discovery, personalised medicine and many others.
                    Measurements in metabolomics studies are routinely performed using <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_chromatography%E2%80%93mass_spectrometry">liquid
                    chromatography mass spectrometry</a> (LC-MS) instruments.
                    Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_mass_spectrometry">tandem mass spectrometry</a>,
                    fragmentation peaks characteristic to a compound can be obtained and used to help establish the
                    identity
                    of the compound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(mass_spectrometry)">Fragmentation spectra</a>,
                    which provide the characteristic fingerprints of compounds, also contain structural information
                    where a
                    subset of fragment peaks may correspond to a shared chemical substructure in a class of compounds.
                    The aim of this site is to provide an online platform that allows users to perform unsupervised
                    substructure discovery in fragmentation experiments,
                    decompose fragmentation experiments into characterized substructures (Mass2Motifs) found in MS/MS
                    spectra of reference compounds,
                    and integrate fragmentation analysis with comparative metabolomics experiments.

                <p>
                    <b>How does it work?</b> In our proposed method (<a
                        href='http://www.pnas.org/content/113/48/13738.abstract'>MS2LDA</a>), discrete fragment and
                    neutral
                    loss features are extracted from fragmentation spectra. Related features that tend to co-occur are
                    detected using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation">Latent
                    Dirichlet
                    Allocation</a> model.
                    The figure below shows the analogy between LDA for text and MS2LDA for fragment and neutral loss
                    features. LDA finds topics interpreted as ‘football related’, ‘business-related’ and ‘environment
                    related’. MS2LDA finds sets of concurring mass fragments or losses (Mass2Motifs) that can be
                    interpreted
                    as ‘Asparagine-related’, ‘Hexose-related’ and ‘Adenine-related’.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The tool currently accepts the fragmentation experiments in various formats (mzML, MSP, MGF) and
                    optionally an MS1 peak list can be added to which the MS1 peaks found in the fragmentation
                    experiment
                    are then matched prior to running LDA or Decomposition.
