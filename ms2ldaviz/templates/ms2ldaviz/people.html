                    Simon is an AI data scientist at NHS National Services Scotland, and also
                    a honorary lecturer in Computer Science, <a href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~srogers/">University of
                    Glasgow</a>.
                    His research interest involves the development of Machine Learning and Statistical techniques to
                    help with the analysis of complex datasets, particularly within the field of Metabolomics but also
                    other -omics fields, Human-Computer Interaction and Information Retrieval.

                    After his PhD in Wageningen, The Netherlands, <a
                        href="http://www.wur.nl/en/Persons/JJJ-Justin-van-der-Hooft-MSc.htm">Justin</a> moved to Glasgow
                    Polyomics to
                    work with Dr Karl Burgess and Prof. Mike Barrett and different partners from Glasgow Polyomics.
                    Justin obtained an ISSF Fellowship from the Wellcome Trust to work on
                    method development and implementation of fragmentation approaches to enhance the metabolite
                    annotation capacities of the high-resolution LC-MS systems focusing on small
                    polar metabolites in urine, beer, and bacterial extracts. Justin has been working on several
                    metabolomics projects thereby exploiting the information-rich fragmentation
                    data that modern mass spectrometers generate and alleviate the bottleneck of metabolite annotation
                    and identification in untargeted metabolomics approaches. In the MS2LDA
                    project, Justin provides valuable biological data interpretations and insights that is crucial to
                    the development of the system. He recently moved back to his academic roots
                    to take up a shared Postdoc position between WUR and the group of Prof. Pieter Dorrestein at the
                    UCSD, USA. The work will be focusing on how to combine workflows developed
                    for genome and metabolome mining to aid in functional annotations of genes and structural
                    annotations of metabolites.

                    Joe is a <a href="https://github.com/joewandy">data scientist</a>
                    at <a href="http://www.polyomics.gla.ac.uk/">Glasgow Polyomics</a>, University of Glasgow. Before
                    working at Glasgow Polyomics, Joe was a PhD student at the <a
                        href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/">School of Computing Science</a>, supervised by
                    Simon.
                    His research interest is in natural language processing and the application of machine learning
                    methods to the analysis of complex biological data.
                    In particular, this also involves the necessary large-scale processing of data required prior to
                    modelling and also the effective visualisations of analysis results.
